# @bugsnag/react-native

Error reporting for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps.

This notifier is for React Native apps that have JS and native code. For [non-ejected](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/workflow/glossary-of-terms/#eject) Expo apps, you'll need to use the [`@bugsnag/expo`](../expo) notifier.
